3. Click on your project: `ewsojaipfkuekybwjmoe`

### Step 2: Open SQL Editor
1. In the left sidebar, click **"SQL Editor"**

### Step 3: Run the Database Setup
1. Copy the ENTIRE content from the file `quick-fix.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor

### Step 4: Verify Success
You should see success messages like:

## If You Still Get Errors

### Check 1: Are you in the right project?
- Make sure you're in the project: `ewsojaipfkuekybwjmoe`
- The URL should be: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ewsojaipfkuekybwjmoe`

### Check 2: Did the SQL run successfully?
- Look for any error messages in the SQL Editor
- All commands should show "success"

### Check 3: Are the tables visible?

## What This Fix Does

- âœ… Create new user accounts

- âœ… Create posts
- âœ… Like/unlike posts
- âœ… View the social media feed
